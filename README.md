# Rating Product & Sorting Reviews in Amazon

One of the most important issues in e-commerce is the accurate calculation of post-sale ratings for products. 
Solving this problem means more customer satisfaction for the e-commerce site, increased product visibility for sellers, and a smooth shopping experience for buyers.

Another problem is the proper sorting of reviews given to products. 
Misleading reviews that appear at the top can directly affect the sales of a product, leading to both financial loss and customer loss.

By solving these two key problems, the e-commerce site and sellers can increase their sales, while customers can complete their purchasing journey seamlessly.
